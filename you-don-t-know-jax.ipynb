    "At its core, you can think of JAX as augmenting `numpy` with the machinery required to perform the aforementioned transformations. JAX's augmented numpy lives at `jax.numpy`. With a few exceptions, you can think of `jax.numpy` as directly interchangeable with `numpy`. As a general rule, you should use `jax.numpy` whenever you plan to use any of JAX's transformations (like computing gradients or just-in-time compiling code) and whenever you want the code to run on an accelerator. You only ever *need* to use `numpy` when you're computing something which is not supported by `jax.numpy`."

Compiling a function also avoids the overhead of the Python interpreter, which helps whether or not you're using an accelerator. In total, `jax.jit` can dramatically speed-up your code with essentially no coding overhead - you just ask JAX to compile the function for you. Even our tiny neural network can see a pretty dramatic speedup when using `jax.jit`:"

This is \"true\" stochastic gradient descent; in practice, when training modern machine learning models we perform \"minibatch\" gradient descent where we average the loss gradients over a mini-batch of examples at each step of gradient descent. JAX provides `jax.vmap`, which is a transformation which automatically \"vectorizes\" a function. What this means is that it allows you to compute the output of a function in parallel over some axis of the input. For us, this means we can apply the `jax.vmap` function transformation and immediately get a version of our loss function gradient which is amenable to using a minibatch of examples. \n",

In our example, we'll use `(None, 0, 0)`, meaning \"don't parallelize over the first argument (`params`), and parallelize over the first (zeroth) dimension of the second and third arguments (`x` and `y`)\".\n",
